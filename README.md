Ubuntu Touch app for BBC News

My first app using QML, so please don't judge too much.

Currently has a main vertical list of sections, with each section being a horizontal list of stories. Tapping a story will push a webview for the story's URL onto the view stack, although this is not optimised for viewing in any way yet.

Makes use of [JSONListModel](https://github.com/kromain/qml-utils).
